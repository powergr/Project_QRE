Based on all the Python libraries we've discussed and implemented across Epics 1, 2, 3, and the initial setup for Epic 4 (API server), here's a `requirements.txt` file.

This file should list the direct dependencies. When you install them, `pip` will also pull in their own dependencies.

```text
# requirements.txt

# Core cryptography and PQC
cryptography
oqs

# Key Derivation
argon2-cffi

# Vault integration
hvac

# API Server
fastapi
uvicorn[standard] # Includes standard dependencies like websockets and watchfiles for --reload

# HTTP client for API tests (and potentially for data_fetcher if you want to pin its version)
httpx

# Utility for system information in benchmarks and UUIDs
psutil
# uuid is part of the Python standard library, no need to list

# For fetching external data (e.g., solar flares)
requests

# For loading .env files in pytest (optional but recommended for local dev)
pytest-dotenv

# For running tests
pytest
```

**Explanation of Key Packages:**

*   **`cryptography`**: For AES, hashing, padding, PBKDF2, HKDF.
*   **`oqs`**: The Python wrapper for liboqs, providing ML-KEM (Kyber) functionality.
*   **`argon2-cffi`**: For the Argon2id Key Derivation Function.
*   **`hvac`**: The Python client for HashiCorp Vault.
*   **`fastapi`**: The web framework for building your API.
*   **`uvicorn[standard]`**: The ASGI server to run your FastAPI application. `[standard]` installs optional dependencies for Uvicorn like `watchfiles` (for `--reload`) and `websockets`.
*   **`httpx`**: A modern HTTP client used in your `pytest` API tests (and potentially could be used by `data_fetcher.py` instead of `requests` if you wanted to standardize on one HTTP client).
*   **`psutil`**: Used in `benchmark_encryption.py` to gather system CPU and memory information.
*   **`uuid`**: Used for generating unique key identifiers. **Note:** `uuid` is part of the Python standard library, so it doesn't *strictly* need to be in `requirements.txt` for `pip` to find it. However, listing it doesn't hurt and can sometimes be useful for explicitness or if older Python versions had it as a separate backport (not the case for modern Python 3). I'll keep it out for a cleaner list of *external* packages.
*   **`requests`**: Used in `data_fetcher.py` to get data from the NOAA API.
*   **`pytest-dotenv`**: (Optional but highly recommended) Allows `pytest` to automatically load environment variables from a `.env` file, which is very useful for managing `VAULT_ADDR`, `VAULT_TOKEN`, and `SERVER_API_KEY` during testing without manually exporting them each time.
*   **`pytest`**: The testing framework itself.

**To Create/Update `requirements.txt` in Your Project:**

1.  **Activate your virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate # or venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
2.  **Ensure all these packages are installed:**
    If you've been following along, they should be. If not, you can install them now:
    ```bash
    pip install cryptography oqs hvac fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" httpx psutil requests pytest pytest-dotenv argon2-cffi
    ```    *(Note: The `oqs` version might need specific handling like `oqs==0.12.0` if `pip install oqs` grabs the wrong one, as discussed before).*
3.  **Generate `requirements.txt` from your active environment:**
    The best way to ensure `requirements.txt` accurately reflects what's working for you (including all transitive dependencies with their specific versions) is to freeze your current environment:
    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    This will create a `requirements.txt` file with all installed packages and their exact versions, e.g.:
    ```
    argon2-cffi==23.1.0
    cryptography==42.0.5
    fastapi==0.110.0
    hvac==1.2.1
    httpx==0.27.0
    oqs==0.10.0 
    # ... and many more dependencies of these packages ...
    psutil==5.9.8
    pytest==8.1.1
    pytest-dotenv==0.5.2
    requests==2.31.0
    uvicorn==0.29.0
    # ... etc.
    ```

**Using the more concise list or `pip freeze`?**

*   **Concise List (like the one at the top of this answer):** Good for showing *direct* dependencies. Simpler for others to read and understand your project's main building blocks. When someone installs from this, `pip` resolves and installs the latest compatible versions of sub-dependencies. This can be good for getting updates but might occasionally lead to issues if a sub-dependency has a breaking change.
*   **`pip freeze` Output:** Good for ensuring **reproducible builds**. Anyone installing from this `requirements.txt` will get the exact same versions of all packages (direct and transitive) that you used, leading to a more consistent environment. This is generally preferred for applications to avoid unexpected behavior due to dependency updates.

**Recommendation:**
For your project, **using the output of `pip freeze > requirements.txt` is generally the best practice for ensuring reproducibility.**

So, the action is:
1. Activate venv.
2. Ensure all necessary packages are installed (e.g., `pip install cryptography oqs==0.12.0 hvac fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" httpx psutil requests pytest pytest-dotenv argon2-cffi`).
3. Run `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

This `requirements.txt` will then be used by your `Dockerfile`.
